# movistar-promo
Microsite for the Movistar team, to sell their mobile plans and phones to the Ecuadorian market. The micro site, was done in Bootstrap 4 and connected via API to Movistar's CRM.
The site was previously hosted at, https://ofertasmovistar.com.ec  Now a at Github pages, to be viewed,  https://bonini81.github.io/movistar-promo/  Since the promo is no longer online. And credit to Notus agency, they took care of the graphic design, i did basically the Front End part with Bootstrap 4 and connected to the API with AJAX.
